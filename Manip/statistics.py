"""from here statistics for the keywords will be calculated and extracted

first attempt to describe the role of the statistics script

1. Get info from pdf file (appearance of the word)

2. Compare the appearance to all the non-ignorable words in the file

3. If the keyword exists inside the keyword field of the pdf info (and if has one) give some priority to that file

4. If the keyword exists in the title give the  biggest priority to the file

NOTE: The program should display all pdf files that may be the ones we want to find

5. If a keyword doesnt'n exist at all in the file then we don't add it in the statistic data extraction process

6. A keyword can be a part of another keyword, a specific function will take care of this

7. The search has to be fast

8. The statistics.py will form a list from pdf files that are probably the ones we want
